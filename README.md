# CALCULATOR-QT
CALCULATOR IN QT :
  A basic calculator that performs calculations on addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. This calculator is developed on QT C++. QT is a software framework for creating GUI based applications in C++ programming language. The calculator will have a simple user interface with a display, a number pad, and buttons for the basic arithmetic operations. The user will be able to enter numbers and perform calculations by clicking on the buttons. The calculator will be implemented using the Qt framework's Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This pattern separates the data (model), the user interface (view), and the logic (controller) into three distinct parts. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
The calculator will be tested using unit tests. Unit tests are small, self-contained tests that verify the functionality of individual units of code. This helps to ensure that the calculator is working properly and that any changes to the code do not introduce new bugs.

Here are some of the features of the calculator:

* Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Support for positive and negative numbers.
* Support for decimal numbers.
* A clear and concise user interface.
* Unit tests to ensure correctness.
* Documentation to help developers understand the code.
* Released under an open-source license.
